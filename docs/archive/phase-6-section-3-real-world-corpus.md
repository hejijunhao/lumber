# Phase 6, Section 3: Expanded Real-World Test Corpus — Completion Notes

**Completed:** 2026-02-24
**Phase:** 6 (Beta Validation & Polish)
**Depends on:** Section 2 (empty-input handling affects how edge cases are treated in the pipeline)

## Summary

Added 49 real-world-patterned log entries to the test corpus, expanding it from 104 to 153 entries. The new entries cover production log formats not represented in the original synthetic corpus: nginx/ALB access logs, Python tracebacks, Kubernetes events, AWS CloudWatch alarms, Docker JSON logs, systemd journal, gRPC errors, Terraform output, Helm release notes, MySQL/PostgreSQL slow query log formats, and more.

All 42 taxonomy leaves remain covered. Corpus validation tests pass. ONNX accuracy testing deferred to an environment with the model downloaded.

### Format Diversity

The new entries add these production log formats not in the original corpus:

| Format | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Nginx combined log | `10.0.1.50 - frank [24/Feb/...] "GET /assets/main.css HTTP/2" 200 ...` |
| AWS ALB access log | `{"elb":"app/prod-alb/...", "target_status_code":200, ...}` |
| Kubernetes Go-style log | `W0224 08:15:00.000000 1 authorization.go:73] Forbidden: ...` |
| Docker JSON log | `{"log":"\\u001b[36minfo\\u001b[39m: Server listening...", "stream":"stdout"}` |
| Systemd journal | `Feb 24 08:30:01 ip-10-0-1-42 systemd[1]: Started api-server.service` |
| PostgreSQL slow log | `LOG:  duration: 8542.301 ms  statement: SELECT ...` |
| MySQL slow log | `# Time: ...\n# User@Host: ...\n# Query_time: ...\nSELECT ...` |
| Python traceback | `Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File ...` |
| Prometheus alert | `FIRING [HighMemoryUsage] — memory_usage_percent{...} = 93.2 > threshold 90` |
| Terraform output | `Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.` |
| Helm release notes | `Release "api-server" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!` |
| gRPC error | `rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = ...` |
| Celery beat | `[celery.beat] INFO Task analytics.tasks.aggregate_daily_stats sent ...` |

## Design Decisions

- **1-2 entries per category, not 5-10** — the goal is format diversity, not volume. Each new entry adds a production log pattern that's semantically distinct from existing entries.
- **Entries are clearly classifiable** — each log contains strong signal for its target category. Ambiguous logs (where reasonable people would disagree on classification) are avoided — the corpus is for validation, not adversarial testing.
- **Multi-line logs included** — Python tracebacks, MySQL slow query logs, and Helm output span multiple lines. These stress-test the tokenizer's handling of `\n` in input.
- **Real service names used** — Stripe, Datadog, ArgoCD, Terraform, Celery — because production logs reference specific tools and the model should handle vendor-specific language.

## ONNX Accuracy Testing

The ONNX model is not available in this environment. The `TestCorpusAccuracy` test will run when the model is present. If any of the 49 new entries misclassify:

1. Check the confidence score — if close to threshold (0.5-0.6), the entry may be genuinely ambiguous
2. Identify the confusion pair — which category did it land in instead?
3. Tune the taxonomy description in `internal/engine/taxonomy/default.go` — add discriminating keywords to the correct category, remove shared language from the confused category
4. Re-run accuracy test to verify

Based on Phase 3 experience (89% → 100% in 3 rounds), description tuning should resolve any misclassifications quickly.

## Verification

```
go test -v github.com/crimson-sun/lumber/internal/engine/testdata   # 3 tests pass (153 entries, 42 leaves covered)
go test ./...                                                        # full suite passes
go test -v -run TestCorpus ./internal/engine/...                     # accuracy test (requires ONNX model)
```

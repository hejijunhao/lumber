# Section 7: End-to-End Integration Tests — Completion Notes

**Completed:** 2026-02-23
**Phase:** 5 (Pipeline Integration & Resilience)
**Depends on:** Sections 1–6 (validates the full stack: structured logging, config validation, per-log error handling, bounded buffer, graceful shutdown, CLI flags)

## Summary

Full pipeline integration tests: httptest server → Vercel connector → real ONNX engine → mock output. Proves all the pieces work as a system. Tests are guarded by `skipWithoutModel(t)` — they skip gracefully when ONNX model files are not present, so `go test ./...` always passes.

## What Changed

### New Files

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `internal/pipeline/integration_test.go` | ~215 | 4 integration tests + 3 helpers + Vercel response types for httptest fixtures |

### Test Helpers

| Helper | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `skipWithoutModel(t)` | Checks `os.Stat` on model path; skips test if ONNX files aren't on disk |
| `newIntegrationEngine(t)` | Creates real embedder → taxonomy → classifier → compactor → engine with `t.Cleanup` for embedder shutdown |
| `newVercelConnector(t)` | Uses `connector.Get("vercel")` from the registry (blank import triggers `init()` registration) |

### Vercel Response Types

Local types (`vercelResponse`, `vercelLogEntry`, `vercelPagination`) that produce the same JSON as the Vercel API. Defined in the test file since the real types are unexported in the `vercel` package.

### Tests Added (4)

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `TestIntegration_VercelStreamThroughPipeline` | Streams 3 realistic logs (connection error, HTTP 200, slow query) through httptest → real engine → mock output. Verifies: correct count, non-empty Type/Category/Severity/Summary, positive confidence. Uses `atomic.Int32` request counter to serve data on first poll only |
| `TestIntegration_VercelQueryThroughPipeline` | Query mode with 3 semantically distinct logs (auth failure, deploy success, resource alert). Verifies batch classification produces correct events with all fields populated |
| `TestIntegration_BadLogDoesNotCrash` | Mixes valid logs with edge cases (empty string, binary content). Verifies pipeline continues without crashing — validates Section 3 skip-and-continue resilience with the real engine |
| `TestIntegration_DedupReducesCount` | Sends 10 identical connection-refused logs with dedup enabled. Verifies output has fewer events, at least one with Count > 1, and all 10 logs accounted for via Count fields |

### Import Dependencies

The integration test imports the full engine stack:

```
github.com/hejijunhao/lumber/internal/engine
github.com/hejijunhao/lumber/internal/engine/classifier
github.com/hejijunhao/lumber/internal/engine/compactor
github.com/hejijunhao/lumber/internal/engine/dedup
github.com/hejijunhao/lumber/internal/engine/embedder
github.com/hejijunhao/lumber/internal/engine/taxonomy
github.com/hejijunhao/lumber/internal/connector
_ github.com/hejijunhao/lumber/internal/connector/vercel  (blank import for init registration)
```

Reuses `mockOutput` from `pipeline_test.go` — both files are in `package pipeline`.

## Design Decisions

- **`skipWithoutModel` over build tags** — `t.Skip()` is simpler and self-documenting. Build tags (`//go:build integration`) require extra flags (`-tags integration`) that are easy to forget. `t.Skip` works with plain `go test` and shows explicit skip reasons in verbose output.
- **Connector via registry, not direct import** — blank import `_ ".../connector/vercel"` + `connector.Get("vercel")` matches the `main.go` pattern. Proves the registry wiring works end-to-end.
- **Query mode for 3 of 4 tests** — Query is synchronous (no goroutine coordination), making tests deterministic. Stream test uses goroutine + polling loop with 10s deadline to avoid brittle `time.Sleep`.
- **`atomic.Int32` request counter in stream test** — httptest handler serves data on first poll, empty on subsequent polls. Prevents duplicate events from re-polling.
- **Flexible assertion in BadLog test (`>= 2` not `== 4`)** — the real engine handles empty/binary gracefully today, but if future changes cause engine errors on degenerate input, the test still passes via Section 3 skip-and-continue. The primary assertion is "no crash".
- **Dedup test uses Query mode** — avoids timing-sensitive stream buffer flushes. `DeduplicateBatch` is called synchronously in `Query()`, making the test fully deterministic.

## Model Paths

```go
const (
    integrationModelPath      = "../../models/model_quantized.onnx"
    integrationVocabPath      = "../../models/vocab.txt"
    integrationProjectionPath = "../../models/2_Dense/model.safetensors"
)
```

Same relative depth as `internal/engine/engine_test.go` — both are two directories below the project root.

## Verification

```
go test ./internal/pipeline/...                        # 10 unit tests pass, 4 integration tests skip
go test -v -run Integration ./internal/pipeline/...    # requires ONNX model for full run
go build ./cmd/lumber                                  # compiles cleanly
go vet ./...                                           # clean
go test ./...                                          # full suite passes
```
